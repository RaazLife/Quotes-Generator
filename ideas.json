                "Dhritarashtra said: O Sanjaya, assembled in the holy land of Kurukshetra and desirous of battle, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?",
                "Sanjaya said: Having observed the Pandava army arrayed for battle, King Duryodhana approached his teacher Drona and spoke the following words.",
                "Behold, O great teacher, the military formation of the army of the sons of På√∂u arranged by your gifted student, Dh®ß†adyumna, the son of Drupada.",
                "Within those ranks are great archers who are equal to Bhîma and Arjuna in war such as Såtyaki, Virå†a and the powerful charioteer Drupada.",
                "Great heroes such as Dh®ß†aketu, Cekitåna, the heroic king of Kåçî, Purujit, Kuntibhoja and Çaibya are also present.",
                "The chivalrous Yudhåmanyu, the courageous Uttamaujå, Abhimanyu the son of Subhadrå, and the sons of Draupadî are indeed all mighty chariot warriors.",
                "However, O best of bråhma√as, you should also know who amongst my army is qualified to lead our military force. Just for your information I shall name them.",
                "Your good self as well as Bhîßma, Kar√a and K®pa are always victorious in battle, as well as Açvatthåmå, Vikar√a, Bhüriçravå and Jayadratha.",
                "They are all armed with various weapons, and they are expert in the art of war. All of them are prepared to give up their very lives for my sake, as are many other warriors.",
                "Our army, protected by the might of Bhîßma is unlimited. However, the strength of the opposition, protected by Bhîma is insufficient.",
                "You must support and protect Bhîßma at all costs, at the strategic points of our battle formation. (Anuvrtti) War is nothing new to this world. Thousands of years ago wars were being fought, such as the one at Kurukßetra, to resolve the differences between good and evil and for the purpose of material gain. From ancient times to our modern era, practically not a day on this Earth has passed when someone, somewhere, was not fighting over some¬thing. Throughout history men have gathered on the field of battle to fulfil their greed for wealth and glory, some-times nobly, but more often ignobly. The same is happen¬ing in the 21st Century. War it seems is an unavoidable karmic destiny of human civilisation. Peace, on the other hand, is rather elusive. Peace is talked about and even prayed for, but seldom makes more than a momentary appearance. Most of our lives, even for the humblest of souls, are spent struggling for existence either socially, politically, financially, mentally or physi¬cally. For most of us the temporary absence of any major crisis is what we would call peace. However, peace (or çånti as it is known amongst yogîs) is a state of consciousness and not a condition relative to the external affairs of the material world. Peace is an internal experience. The wisdom of the Vedic literature, Çrîmad Bhågavatam says, jîvo-jîvasya-jîvanaμ – one living being is food for another living being. From the minutest forms of life to the most complex, one life is sustained by the loss of another. Thus, the basic principle for material existence is fundamentally flawed with violence. Peace then, for most of us, comes in doing what we have to do and believing that we have done the right thing. Therein lies the fine line between war and peace. Is what we think to be good, or what we are conditioned to believe, actually right? The ability to discriminate between right and wrong, or in some cases good and evil, largely depends on the extent of knowledge from which we draw our conclusions. A poor fund of knowledge naturally results in faulty conclusions. Therefore, it is in our best interest to seek out the greatest source of knowledge – knowledge of the Absolute Truth, and familiarise ourselves with that. Bhagavad-gîtå is perhaps the most widely read book of theistic knowledge in the world. Whatever knowledge one finds in similar books such as the Dhammapada, the Bible, the Torah, the Koran etc. is also found in the Bhaga¬ vad-gîtå. But in the Bhagavad-gîtå one will find knowl¬edge that is not present anywhere else. Consequently, the Bhagavad-gîtå surpasses all branches of knowledge. What lies ahead in these commentaries is a look into the vastness of the knowledge of the Absolute Truth contained in the Bhagavad-gîtå.",
                "Then Bhîßma, the fearless grandsire of the Kuru Dynasty, roaring like a lion, blew his conch loudly to increase the euphoria of Duryodhana.",
                "At that point, conches, trumpets, bugles, drums and horns suddenly sounded all at once and the combined sound rose up like thunder.",
                "On the other side of the battlefield, both Sri Krsna, the husband of the goddess of wealth, and Arjuna, sitting on a wonderful chariot yoked with horses of fair hue, blew their divine conches.",
                "Sri Krsna, the Master of the senses, blew his conch-shell called Påñcajanya. Arjuna, the winner of great wealth, blew his conch-shell called Devadatta. Bhîma, the performer of great feats, blew his conch-shell Paun∂ra.",
                "Yudhiß†hira, the son of Kuntî, blew his conch-shell Anan¬ta-vijaya.",
                "Nakula and Sahadeva blew their conches called Sughoßa and Ma√ipußpaka.",
                "O emperor, the great archer the king of Kåçî, the expert chariot warrior Çikha√∂i, Dh®ß†adyumna, Virå†a, the invincible Såtyaki, Drupada, the sons of Draupadî and Abhimanyu the mighty son of Subhadrå all blew their conches."
